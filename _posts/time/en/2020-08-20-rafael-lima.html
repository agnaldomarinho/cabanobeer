bio:
- Rafael Lima showed interest for the business world since he was a young boy. At 8 he won his first computer and at 12 he started coding. At 21 he started his first company, where he created software products. He was responsible for creating CSS Browser Selector, which achieved worlwide recognition.
- Innovating again, he decided to create a new way of selling software which could solve the problems of selling projects. Then arose Startupdev, which resulted in he becoming a partner in HE:labs.
- Rafael has great interest in disseminating his knowledge. Because of that, he's a volunteer in a multitude of initiatives which promoted activities and the emergence of new start-ups. Furthermore, he's responsible for the creation of Bootstrappers and is a mentor of Startupfarm.
- Rafael loves challenges and because of that, despite his fear of heights, he already has skydived, and he's looking forward to his first bungee jump.
