            <h2>Seeking a Perfect Partner<b>Why HE:labs?</b></h2>
            <p>
              Atende Simples has a very complex operation, involving lots of technologies, companies and systems.
              The voice platform was the responsibility of VoxAge, in São Paulo.
              It was necessary to decide the best way to create our web application:
            </p>
            <ul class="topics">
              <li>Hire developers</li>
              <li>Hire freelancers</li>
              <li>Hire a development company</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The first two options had various risks:</p>
            <ul class="topics">
              <li>Would need someone to control the work of developers, putting weight on the structure early on the company.</li>
              <li>There was a possibility of being dependent on the freelancers during a heated market.</li>
              <li>The effort to replace individual developers or freelancers who leave the project would be considerable.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              "The most important thing for Atende Simples is the user experience. Then the price. The value has to be fair and feasible for the targeted customer. And finally, functionality. We must always be one step ahead of the customer to ensure that the service helps businesses succeed in simple ways."

            <h2>A Telco Middleware</h2>
            <p>For some tasks, the team had to study specifics of the application domain. The telecommunications back-end is a example. We were building a telco middleware in the cloud. Behind it, the system was composed in large 3 blocks:</p>
            <ul class="topics">
              <li>A web interface, for the final users, where everything had to be simple. Here is where all end-users interact with the service.</li>
              <li>A mid-field acting as the glue between the settings and tweaks by the end-user, and the telco services. This glue is a web service that runs on top of a physical telecommunications infrastructure for performance reasons.</li>
              <li>The phone and voice system itself, which is developed by VoxAge.</li>

            <h3>The first customer!</h3>
            <p>After a few months of development by HE:labs and VoxAge setting up equipment, and the telco infrastructure activated, the big moment arrived: the first customer!</p>
            <p>The feedback after the test drive with Luz.vc, a Brazilian small business consultancy firm, had been super positive. “Great! Very simple. And fast!” That last word made ​​a difference. The team realized that simplicity helped speed up a user on-boarding process that is usually slow.</p>
