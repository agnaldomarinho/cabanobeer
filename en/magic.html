        <li>
          <h4>Client ideation</h4>
          For the first time we meet, both client and team speak about the project's short
          and long term vision.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Wireframe sketching</h4>
          Client and team sketch each page as they imagine it developed.

            <div class="show-content">
              <p>The objective of this stage is to extract everyone's main ideas (client's and team's) and, by communicating via the illustrations, agree on what needs to get done.</p>
              <p>When we speak of wireframe sketching, we literally mean a drawing of what you imagine your interface to be. Simple pen and paper drawing. <a href="/pdfs/exemplo-de-desenho.pdf" target="_blank" data-no-instant>Check out an example!</a></p>
              <div class="modalEntry">
                <p><strong>1.</strong> Everyone from our team and the client makes individual sketches of the interface as they imagine;</p>
                <p><strong>2.</strong> The sketches should reflect the application's flow. How users should interact with the application, which elements must exist and things of this nature;</p>
                <p><strong>3.</strong> Everyone presents their sketch and there's a discussion regarding the best components;</p>
                <p><strong>4.</strong> Creation of a final sketch, which becomes the delivery for the next phase.</p>

          <h4>Breaking stories into tasks and estimating</h4>
          The team dissolves the final sketch into design and programming tasks, where each team member attributes his or her own estimate.

              <p>The main objective here is to find out what and how much effort is necessary for your development.</p>
              <div class="modalEntry">
                <p><strong>1.</strong> After the team discusses the sketches, we create a step-by-step walkthrough for each sketched screen. We call these user stories, where inside each, there are a bunch of tasks;</p>
                <p><strong>2.</strong> At our workplace, we use boards to either list out or draw all of the necessary components to bring each sketch (data models, etc.) to life;</p>
                <p><strong>3.</strong> Each task has X points. Everyone on the team estimates how many points they think the task is worth;</p>
                <p><strong>4.</strong> The point system used is 1, 2, 4 or 8, which represents the team's effort in relation to a user story;</p>

        <h4>Prioritizing the tasks</h4>
          Client prioritizes the tasks to be executed for the week.

            <div class="show-content">
              <p>After knowing the effort for each task, it's time to prioritize them and define which are the most important to get done for the week.</p>
              <div class="modalEntry">
                <p><strong>1.</strong> Client re-arranges the tasks in order of importantance, regardless of effort;</p>
                <p><strong>2.</strong> The team helps the client to prioritize, pointing out any complexities of each task at hand;</p>
                <p><strong>3.</strong> Client prioritizes an average of 30 points per person on the team. For example: a team with 2 people would deliver approximately 60 points;</p>
                <p><strong>4.</strong> At the end of priotization, client and team agree on the scope for that week;</p>

              <p>All projects have a testing environment, called staging. Staging works online so that client and team can execute tests somewhere as similar as possible to what's on production.</p>
              <div class="modalEntry">
                <p><strong>1.</strong> The staging environment is secured with login credentials so that only those with access rights may enter;</p>

              <p>The team utilizes a range of best practices: automated-testing, 100% line coverage and continuous integration.</p>
              <div class="modalEntry">
                <p><strong>1.</strong> Each line of code has been executed at least once in order to guarantee its functionality. This way, new functionalities do not affect old ones;</p>
                <p><strong>2.</strong> We have to test everything! After this, we guarantee 100% we'll cover your tests. In other words, there won't be one single line of code that has not been tested;</p>
                <p><strong>3.</strong> Every small portion of written code is sent to staging, a process that happens multiple times per day, guaranteeing there are no surprises on your production environment.</p>

          Client uses Friday to QA what was developed by following instructions from the testing script provided. The document is also used by the client to take notes and observations for our next meeting the following Monday.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Internal and Open Source projects</h4>
          While the client is QAing the system, the team takes the opportunity to work on internal company projects, like contributing to <a href="/opensource/">open source</a> projects, writing <a href="http://helabs.com.br/blog/" data-no-instant>blog</a> posts, as well as workshops and other forms of technical improvement.
        </li>
